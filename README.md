## Fix Mod Textures on Wuthering Waves Ultra Performance Graphic Setting
### If you wanna fork/continuing/contributing to this fixer tool
Before dumping the textures
Please do:
1. Make sure on your Engine.ini wuwa config. There's line r.Streaming.Boost = x. To make sure the textures are loaded at its highest res for the current graphic setting.
2. Make sure you already restart the game in Ultra Performance. Or you start the game while it's already on Ultra Performance graphic setting.
3. Make sure you tested it first.

#### Tools to help find hashes
- [Image Comparator](https://github.com/Aglglg/Image-Comparator) - get matching textures between Quality & Ultra Performance textures (the calculation is auto, but it is very slow)
