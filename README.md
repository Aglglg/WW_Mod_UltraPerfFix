## Fix Mod Textures on Wuthering Waves Ultra Performance Graphic Setting
### If you wanna fork/continuing/contributing to this fixer tool
Before dumping the textures
Please do:
1. Make sure on your Engine.ini wuwa config. There's line r.Streaming.FullyLoadUsedTextures=1
2. Make sure you already restart the game in Ultra Performance. Or you start the game while it's already on Ultra Performance graphic setting.
3. Make sure you tested it first.
4. Make sure when listing those hashes you're in Ultra FOCUSED state to minimalize error or wrong hashes pairs.
5. Make sure you don't modify the rust code. Or if you do (to make sure it's working for your own fork/repo or any other things), make sure you do not do any malicious things.

#### Tools to help find hashes
